## 🔧 Running Tests

### Prerequisites

1. **Migrations Run** - All 7 badge migrations executed
2. **App Running** - Dev server on localhost:3000
3. **Test User** (optional) - For authenticated tests

### Commands

```bash
# Run all tests
npm run test:e2e

# Run badge tests only
npm run test:e2e -- badges

# Run specific test
npm run test:e2e -- badges.spec.ts -g "should load badges page"

# Run in headed mode (see browser)
npm run test:e2e -- badges.spec.ts --headed

# Generate HTML report
npm run test:e2e -- badges.spec.ts --reporter=html
```

## 🎓 Test Patterns Used

### Authentication Handling
```typescript
const isAuthenticated = await page.locator('text=My Cookbook').isVisible().catch(() => false);
if (!isAuthenticated) {
  test.skip(); // Skip if not logged in
}
```

### Error Collection
```typescript
const errors: string[] = [];
page.on('console', msg => {
  if (msg.type() === 'error') {
    errors.push(msg.text());
  }
});
```

### Network Monitoring
```typescript
const eventRequests: any[] = [];
page.on('request', request => {
  if (request.url().includes('log_event')) {
    eventRequests.push(request.url());
  }
});
```

## 🐛 Known Test Limitations

### Why Some Tests Are Skipped

1. **Database Access** - E2E tests can't directly query Supabase
2. **Test Data** - Need controlled data to test badge thresholds
3. **Time-Based** - Cooldown tests require waiting 5+ minutes
4. **Integration** - Event logging not yet wired throughout app

### Workarounds

- Manual SQL tests for database validation
- Test fixtures for controlled data (future enhancement)
- Skip time-based tests in CI
- Enable integration tests after wiring complete

---

## 📝 Test Checklist

### Before Running Tests

- [ ] Migrations 001-007 executed in Supabase

- [ ] Badge page accessible at `/badges`
- [ ] Test user created (optional)

### After Running Tests

- [ ] Review test report
- [ ] Check for skipped tests
- [ ] Verify error logs
- [ ] Update test data if needed
