# Recipe Chef - Session Summary

## All Issues Fixed âœ…

### 1. Recipe Finder Cache Issue (RESOLVED)
- **Problem:** Old cached code running despite new search logic
- **Fix:** Cleared .next cache, added null safety checks, restarted dev server

### 2. Ingredient Matching Issues (RESOLVED)
Fixed multiple parsing problems preventing ingredients from being found:

#### Issue A: Orange & Lemon Not Found
- **Cause:** "quartered" not removed, searching for "quartered" instead
- **Fix:** Added `halved`, `quartered` to removal list

#### Issue B: Chicken Broth Not Found  
- **Cause:** Matched "chicken" before "chicken broth"
- **Fix:** Check two-word ingredients BEFORE single-word

#### Issue C: Roasting Chicken Not Found
- **Cause:** "roasting" was being removed as preparation method
- **Fix:** Removed from removal list (it's part of ingredient names)

#### Issue D: Limes Not Found
- **Cause:** "fish" matched before "lime" in ordered list
- **Fix:** Reordered list - citrus BEFORE proteins

#### Issue E: Lobster Meat Not Found
- **Cause:** "meat" matched before "lobster"
- **Fix:** Added "lobster meat" to two-word list, moved specific meats before generic "meat"

#### Issue F: Squid Not Found
- **Cause:** Not in common ingredients list
- **Fix:** Added seafood: squid, calamari, octopus, clams, mussels, oysters, scallops

#### Issue G: Cilantro & Avocado Not Found
- **Cause:** Not in common ingredients list
- **Fix:** Added herbs (cilantro, basil, thyme, rosemary) and avocado

#### Issue H: White Fish & Fish Fillets Not Found
- **Cause:** Not in two-word ingredients list
- **Fix:** Added fish variations to two-word list

### 3. Add Recipe Page 401 Error (RESOLVED)
- **Problem:** URL importer returned "Authentication required" error
- **Cause:** Supabase SSR couldn't read `base64-` prefixed auth cookies
- **Fix:** 
  - Parse cookie manually
  - Call `setSession()` with extracted tokens
  - Added fallback to use cookie user data
  - Added `credentials: 'include'` to fetch call

### 4. Recipe Import Flow (IMPROVED)
- **Problem:** Imported recipes went to view page, no chance to edit first
- **Fix:** 
  - Changed redirect from `/recipe/{id}` to `/recipe/{id}/edit`
  - Save and redirect immediately (skip preview screen)
- **Benefit:** Users can now review and modify imported recipes before finalizing

### 5. JSON-LD Complex Objects (RESOLVED)
- **Problem:** Schema.org objects appearing in fields instead of simple values
  - Image field showed: `{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"...","height":1125}`
  - Author showed: `{"@type":"Person","name":"Chef John"}`
  - Times showed: `PT15M` instead of `15m`
  - Servings was blank despite data
- **Fix:** Enhanced normalization in `normalizeRecipeData()`:
  - ImageObject â†’ Extract just the URL
  - Person/Organization â†’ Extract just the name
  - HowToStep/HowToSection â†’ Extract just the text
  - ISO 8601 Duration (PT15M) â†’ Readable format (15m)
  - RecipeYield â†’ Handle strings, numbers, arrays, objects
  - NutritionInformation â†’ Extract simple values
  - AggregateRating â†’ Extract numeric values
- **Benefit:** Clean, editable values in all form fields

### 6. Global Recipe URL Import (NEW FEATURE)
- **Request:** Copy URL import functionality to Global Cookbook admin page
- **Implementation:**
  - Added URL import card to `/admin/global-recipes/add` page
  - Reuses existing `/api/import-recipe` endpoint (already has auth)
  - Populates form with imported data for admin review
  - Saves with `raw_name` ingredients for later analysis
  - Redirects to global recipe edit page
- **Benefit:** Admins can quickly add high-quality recipes from the web to global cookbook
- **Access:** Admin role required (already enforced)

## Key Improvements

### Ingredient Parsing Priority (Critical!)

**Two-Word Ingredients (Checked FIRST):**
- Broths & stocks: chicken broth, beef broth, vegetable broth, etc.
- Chicken parts: roasting chicken, chicken breast, chicken wings, etc.
- Ground meats: ground beef, ground pork, ground turkey
- Seafood: lobster meat, crab meat, white fish, fish fillets
- Oils: olive oil, coconut oil, sesame oil
- Sauces: soy sauce, fish sauce, worcestershire sauce
- Peppers & powders: black pepper, garlic powder, chili powder

**Single-Word Ingredients (Checked SECOND):**
- Order matters! Specific before generic:
  - Citrus BEFORE proteins: lemon, lime, orange, chicken, beef, pork, fish
  - Specific meats BEFORE "meat": chicken, beef, lobster, crab, squid... THEN meat
  - Herbs early: cilantro, basil, thyme, rosemary, oregano

### Removal List Enhanced
**Now removes:** halved, quartered, reduced, sodium, firm, tender, fresh, freshly, squeezed, strained, pulp, cubed, bodies, squares, rounds, sprigs, stems, thinly, neck, giblets, discarded

**Does NOT remove:** roasting, wings, breast, thighs, drumsticks (part of ingredient names!)

## Recipe Parsing Order (Already Optimal!)

1. âœ… JSON-LD (schema.org/Recipe) - HIGH confidence
2. âœ… Microdata (itemtype) - HIGH confidence
3. âœ… RDFa (property/vocab) - MEDIUM confidence
4. âœ… h-recipe (Microformats) - MEDIUM confidence
5. âœ… Heuristic HTML - LOW confidence

Matches Google and Schema.org recommendations!
