## 🚀 Deployment Checklist

### Phase 1: Database Setup (30 min)
- [ ] Run migrations 001-007 in Supabase SQL Editor
- [ ] Verify: `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM badges;` returns 16

- [ ] Confirm: RLS policies are active

### Phase 2: Client Integration (5 min)
- [ ] Add `BadgeToastProvider` to app layout
- [ ] Test: Navigate to `/badges` page
- [ ] Verify: Badges page loads without errors

### Phase 3: Wire Events (2-4 hours)
- [ ] Add event logging to recipe creation
- [ ] Add event logging to calendar
- [ ] Add event logging to shopping list
- [ ] Add event logging to ratings (if applicable)
- [ ] Test each integration thoroughly

### Phase 4: Scheduler (30 min)
- [ ] Set up nightly `award_badges_for_all_users()` job
- [ ] Test manually first
- [ ] Verify execution via logs

1. **README_BADGE_SYSTEM.md** - Quick start guide
2. **BADGE_EVENT_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md** - Wire events
3. **BADGE_SCHEDULER_SETUP.md** - Set up scheduler

### For Development
- `src/lib/badges.ts` - Import event logging functions

- `migrations/` - Database setup

### For Testing
```sql
-- Check events
SELECT * FROM user_events WHERE user_id = auth.uid();

-- Check badges
SELECT * FROM user_badges WHERE user_id = auth.uid();

-- Test award
SELECT * FROM award_badges_for_user(auth.uid());
```

## 💡 Integration Priority

**HIGH PRIORITY** (implement first):
1. Recipe added events (manual + import)
2. Calendar added events
3. Shopping list generated events

**MEDIUM PRIORITY**:
4. Rating left events
5. AI query events

**LOW PRIORITY** (when features exist):
6. Recipe cooked events
7. Unit conversion events
8. Alexa push events
9. Bug report events

## 🎨 Badge Families

Badges are organized into thematic families:

- 🍳 **Cooking** - Recipe Maker, Cuisine Explorer
- 📚 **Collecting** - Curator
- ⭐ **Quality** - Top Rated Chef
- 👥 **Community** - Recipe Judge, Crowd Favorite, Bug Hunter
- ✨ **Creativity** - Original Creator
- 📅 **Planning** - Monthly Meal Master, List Legend
- 🔥 **Expertise** - Regional Specialist
- 🗺️ **Exploration** - Ingredient Adventurer
- 🛠️ **Tools** - Conversion Wizard
- 🤖 **Technology** - Alexa Ally
- 🧠 **AI** - Chef Tony Apprentice
- 🎄 **Seasonal** - Holiday Baker

---

## 🐛 Known Edge Cases Handled

✅ **No ingredients** - Anti-gaming filters out  
✅ **Rapid recipe adds** - 5-minute cooldown  
✅ **Missing auth** - RPCs check `auth.uid()`  
✅ **Event logging failure** - Never blocks user action  
✅ **Badge calc errors** - Wrapped in exception handlers  
✅ **Concurrent updates** - UPSERT handles conflicts  
✅ **Missing meta fields** - COALESCE with defaults  

---

## 📈 Performance Considerations

- **Indexed queries** on user_id, type, created_at
- **Batched awards** in nightly job
- **Lightweight logging** with `logEvent()`
- **View optimization** with window functions
- **JSON indexing** on profiles.badges with GIN

---

## 🔐 Security Audit

✅ **RLS enabled** on all user-facing tables  
✅ **SECURITY DEFINER** RPCs use authenticated user  
✅ **No SQL injection** - Parameterized queries  
✅ **Read-only catalog** - Users can't modify badges  
✅ **Admin checks** - Role verification for admin RPCs  
✅ **Event validation** - Enum types prevent invalid data  

---

## 🎉 Success Metrics

Track these after launch:
- Event log entries per day
- Badges earned per user (average)
- Toast notification views
- Badge page visits
- User engagement increase
- Most earned badges
