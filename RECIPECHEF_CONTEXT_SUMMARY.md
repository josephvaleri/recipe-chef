## Current Issue
The "About Chef Tony" page (`src/app/about-chef-tony/page.tsx`) has JSX syntax errors that need to be fixed before updating the biographical content with the user's new text.

**Specific Build Errors:**
1. **Line 284**: JSX parsing error - malformed structure around the "4" text in a div
2. **Line 391**: `React.createElement` error - React not properly imported/handled in the timeline section

**User's Request:** Replace the existing biographical content with new text that includes:
- More detailed life journey from Annapolis → Seattle → Ellicott City → Umbria
- Enhanced story about meeting Giulia and moving to Italy
- Updates about his parents also moving to Umbria
- COVID-era cooking with family via video calls
- More details about his role as Global Cookbook curator and recipe inventor

## Development Environment
- Local dev server running on `http://localhost:3000`
- Hot reload enabled with Turbopack
- Real-time error reporting in terminal

## Next Steps
1. Fix the JSX syntax errors (lines 284 and 391)
2. Replace the biographical content in the main story section with the user's new text
3. Ensure the page compiles and displays correctly

This is a production-ready application with comprehensive features for recipe management, meal planning, and user engagement through the badge system.
