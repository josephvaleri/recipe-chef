# ðŸ¤– AI Question Routing System - Implementation Complete

## âœ… **Feature Overview**

I've successfully implemented a comprehensive AI question routing system that intelligently processes user questions and routes them to the appropriate response mechanism.

## ðŸŽ¯ **How It Works**

### **1. Question Classification**
When a user asks a question (text or voice), the system:
- **Classifies the question** into one of three categories:
  - `recipe_search` - Looking for specific recipes
  - `cooking_question` - General cooking/food questions  
  - `not_food_related` - Non-food questions

### **2. Recipe Search Flow**
For recipe-related questions:
1. **Searches User's Cookbook** first for matching recipes
2. **Searches Global Cookbook** for additional matches
3. **Scores recipes** based on title word matching
4. **If good matches found (â‰¥75%)**: Redirects to Recipe Finder with results
5. **If no good matches**: Asks OpenAI to generate recipes in JSON-LD format
6. **Redirects to Recipe Finder** with AI-generated recipes

### **3. General Cooking Questions**
For non-recipe food questions:
1. **Enhances the question** for optimal AI performance
2. **Sends to OpenAI** with Chef Tony's persona
3. **Displays answer** in the answer box below Chef Tony

### **4. Non-Food Questions**
- **Politely redirects** users to ask food-related questions

## ðŸ”§ **Technical Implementation**
