# Ingredient Parsing Fixes - Complete Summary

## Issues Fixed

### ✅ Issue 1: Orange & Lemon Not Found
- **Problem:** "quartered" wasn't being removed, so it searched for "quartered" instead of "orange"/"lemon"
- **Solution:** Added `halved`, `quartered` to removal list

### ✅ Issue 2: Chicken Broth Not Found  
- **Problem:** Found "chicken" before checking for "chicken broth"
- **Root Cause:** Single-word ingredients checked before two-word ingredients
- **Solution:** 
  - Created `commonTwoWordIngredients` list
  - Check two-word ingredients FIRST, then single-word
  - Now finds "chicken broth" in aliases table ✅

### ✅ Issue 3: Roasting Chicken Not Found
- **Problem:** "roasting" was being removed as a preparation method
- **Root Cause:** "roasting", "wings", "breast", etc. were in the removal list
- **Solution:** 
  - Removed these words from removal list since they're part of ingredient names
  - "Roasting Chicken", "Chicken Wings", "Chicken Breast" are all specific ingredients

## All Fixes Applied

### 1. Text Cleaning (Line 591)
**Added to removal list:**
- `halved`, `quartered` (preparation methods)
- `reduced`, `sodium` (descriptors)
- `neck`, `giblets`, `discarded` (non-ingredient parts)

**Removed from removal list:**
- `roasting`, `wings`, `thighs`, `breast`, `breasts`, `drumsticks`, `legs`, `meat`
- These are parts of ingredient names and must be preserved

### 2. Exclusion Filter (Line 640)
**Removed from exclusion:**
- `chicken`, `vegetable`, `broth`, `orange`
- These are actual ingredients and should never be filtered out

### 3. Two-Word Search Limit (Line 489)
**Changed:** 3 → 6 word pairs
- Now checks more combinations to find "chicken broth" in "cans reduced-sodium chicken broth"

### 4. Common Ingredients Priority (Lines 646-675)
**New two-word ingredients list (checked FIRST):**
- Broths: `chicken broth`, `beef broth`, `vegetable broth`
- Stocks: `chicken stock`, `beef stock`, `vegetable stock`
- Chicken parts: `roasting chicken`, `whole chicken`, `chicken breast`, `chicken thigh`, `chicken wings`, `chicken drumsticks`
- Ground meats: `ground beef`, `ground pork`, `ground turkey`
- Oils: `olive oil`, `coconut oil`, `sesame oil`, `vegetable oil`
- Sauces: `soy sauce`, `fish sauce`, `worcestershire sauce`, `hot sauce`
- Peppers: `black pepper`, `white pepper`, `red pepper`, `cayenne pepper`
- Powders: `garlic powder`, `onion powder`, `chili powder`, `curry powder`

**Single-word ingredients list (checked SECOND):**
- Only searched if no two-word match found
- Includes: eggs, garlic, onion, chicken, beef, pork, lemon, orange, etc.
